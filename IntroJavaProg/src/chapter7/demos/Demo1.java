/**
Single dimension array named cost
Holds 7 costs
Input 1: hard coded values
Input 2: a) entered from the user input using a FOR LOOP
         b) accumulator to add costs is done in loop 
            sum = sum + cost[index];
         c) average is then calculated
         d) now, how will we find how many costs are above and below the average?
